But no one likes to say, hear, or in fact read that, obviously. And since HtDP-TL and Racket are quite similar and everyone calls it Racket anyway, I am sticking with that.</p></div></div>\n<p>Racket is a <em>functional programming language</em>, which means that in Racket (almost) everything we do is through functions.</p>\n<p>Let’s say, for example, we want to calculate <code class=\"language-text\">2 + 3</code> in Racket, because that task is obviously way too complex to do it by hand. We <strong>can’t</strong> just write <code class=\"language-text\">2 + 3</code> because Racket wouldn’t understand that. <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> however is a <em>function</em>, which means we can <em>call</em> it. <em>Calling</em> a function means that we let the function do its calculation and then get its result back. For that calculation functions often need data to do these calculations, numbers to add for example. These data is what we call <em>parameters</em> or <em>arguments</em>.</p>\n<p>To calculate <code class=\"language-text\">2 + 3</code> we call the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code>-function with 2 and 3 as parameters. Calling a function in Racket looks like this: <code class=\"language-text\">(name param1 param2 ...)</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"racket\"><pre class=\"language-racket\"><code class=\"language-racket\">(+ 2 3)\n&gt; 5</code></pre></div>\n<p>So what just happened there? We called a function with the name <code class=\"language-text\">+</code>, which is predefined in the Racket language, with the parameters 2 and 3. This function then calculated this addition and <em>returned</em> it, meaning it gave us the result back.</p>\n<p>And <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> isn’t the only function Racket gives us right out of the box. There are a lot of them and we will explore a lot of them later, but here are some arithmetic functions:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"racket\"><pre class=\"language-racket\"><code class=\"language-racket\">(- 5 3)\n&gt; 2\n\n(* 2 3)\n&gt; 6\n\n(/ 8 4)\n&gt; 2</code></pre></div>\n<p>Okay, so we know what functions are. Great! But are there other things in Racket? We already used numbers, is there more? And what’s the difference between functions and other things?</p>\n<h2>Primitives and Expressions</h2>\n<p>In Racket (and most other languages) we have <em>primitives</em>. Primitives are <em>expressions</em> that are their own value. The number <code class=\"language-text\">2</code> for example <strong>is</strong> <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>. That is its value and how it represented and used. Functions however are not their own value, we have to <em>evaluate</em> them to get it.</p>\n<p>There are other primitives in Racket, like booleans, strings and symbols. Booleans are either <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> (short: <code class=\"language-text\">#t</code>) or <code class=\"language-text\">false</code> (short: <code class=\"language-text\">#f</code>). Strings are basically text, like <code class=\"language-text\">“This is my text.”</code> and symbols, like <code class=\"language-text\">&#39;cat</code> are somewhat similar to strings, but can’t have whitespace and are easier to compare.</p>\n<p>We will explore all of these in more detail later and use all of them in examples, so you can familiarize with them.</p>\n<p>In the next part, we will dive deep into functions.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"03 December 2018","title":"Introduction to Racket","topic":"FOOP"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/foop/racket-intro/","topic":"FOOP","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/foop/foop-intro/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction to FOOP","topic":"FOOP"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/foop/racket-functions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Functions","topic":"FOOP"}},"previousInTopic":{"fields":{"slug":"/foop/foop-intro/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction to FOOP","topic":"FOOP"}},"nextInTopic":{"fields":{"slug":"/foop/racket-functions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Functions","topic":"FOOP"}}}}
