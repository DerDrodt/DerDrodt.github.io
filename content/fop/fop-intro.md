In this series of blog posts, we will examine and learn the contents of the basics of the lecture "Funktionale und objektorientierte Programmierkonzepte" from the TU Darmstadt.

[[warning | DISCLAIMER]]
| This series is in no way official and there are no guarantees that it is 100% correct nor conform with the lecture contents. It is only intended to further explain the languages used in FoP, namely Java and Racket and the concepts introduced.

We will first begin to explain the functional language Racket, will then go over to Java and end with comparing the two. Along the way, we will learn common best practices, styles and methods in programming and learn how to best avoid mistakes.
